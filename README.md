Welcome to Movie_List! This gem is designed to get trending movies and shows from an external source API then display the results to the user. As an added bonus, the user will be able to input a title number to get a list of where the movie or show is available to watch. Enjoy!



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movie_list'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie_list

## Usage

Feel free to use within the guidelines of the MIT license.

TODO: Write usage instructions here:

You will need to get your own API key from themoviedb.com or the application will not be able to get the data.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
