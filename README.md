# MovieList

Welcome to Movie_List! This gem is designed to get trending movies and shows from an external source API then display the results to the user. As an added bonus, the user will be able to input a title number to get a list of where the movie or show is available to watch. Enjoy!

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'movie_list'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage


TODO: Write usage instructions here:

You will need to get your own API key from themoviedb.com or the application will not be able to get the data.
