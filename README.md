Movie List

A CLI project that finds and organizes movies, or shows, from an external source then displays them to the user and where to watch them.

Using net/http to retreive data from TheMovieDB.com API, makes new Ruby classes to represent the data which is then visible through the command line.

I used dotenv to hide my API key but TheMovieDB.com can provide you a key as well.
